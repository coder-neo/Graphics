Most of the game structure follow the assignment.
I have added three creatures, move towards side, other randomly moves downward and third coily moves randomly to any position.

Extra credits done:
------------------

5% Animate QBert. Describe a nice arc during motion, change QBert's shape a bit.
5% Animate creatures. Describe a nice arc during motion, change creature shape a bit.
5% Multiple lives. More than one life for QBert. Show the number of remaining lives.
5% Event Sound. On certain game events, e.g. game start, movement, etc. Some QBert sounds are here and here, but feel free to use your own.
5% Multiple levels. When all board squares change color, a different board is presented to the player. Show the number of the current level.
5% Level transitions. Between levels, there is a cool animated transition to the new level.
5% Enable Scoring. You can choose any scoring scale you want. Display the score.





In this game I have tried to replicate the Qbert game, nothing fancy. Here coily instead of following qbert moves randomly and instead of spheres I have used ghost pokemon for fun. You can find more about this game here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q*bert
